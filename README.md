This is the structure of a data base for a farm for my second Project at solvd Testing Automation Course.


I separate the whole schema in 4 layers:

The tables in the Animal layer are:
### animal

### status
This table allow us to define status to the animals. If they are on feeding, to breed, or in the process of slaughter.
Columns: id, status_name.
### objective
Similar to the status but here we storage the final objective of that animal since it entered the process of the farm.
Columns: id, objective_name.
