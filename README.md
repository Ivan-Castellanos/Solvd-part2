This is the structure of a data base for a farm for my second Project at solvd Testing Automation Course.


I separate the whole schema in 4 layers: 

# Animals
This part of the database is designed to storage data about the principal product of our farm, the animals.
The tables in the Animal layer are:
### animal
The data of every single animal in the farm is stored here.
### status
This table allow us to define status to the animals. If they are on feeding, to breed, or in the process of slaughter.
### objective
Similar to the status but here we storage the final objective of that animal since it entered the process of the farm.
### breed
In the breed table, we to storage the breed of every animal this table works realy close with the specie table.
### specie
The specie table, we have the animals specie that we have actualiy working on our farm. Based on the specie we could define a price per kg at the moment of selling it's meat.
# Buildings
Since we have several buildings inside of our farm,with diferent kind of uses for the animals. we use this layer for all information related to this buildings.
### building
The buiding table is where we store all the data of every building in our company.
### b_type
The building type is where we storage the variety of building finality, If it is for example a place for feeding. This is where that data is storaged.
### city
Since we have several buildings in diferents city, this table have the data of which citys have at least one of them.
### phone_number
Our buildings sometime have more than a phone number. So in order to respect the normal form of the data bases we store them in this table.
